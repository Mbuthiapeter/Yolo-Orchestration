Yolo-Orchestration
Yolo is an e-commerce platform.

This project deploys an application (e-commerce 'YOLO') using Kubernetes orchestration concepts on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

Features
Upload images for object detection
Perform object detection using the YOLO algorithm
View the detected objects in the uploaded images
Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Object Detection: YOLO algorithm
Containerization: Docker
Orchestration: Kubernetes
Declarative files: YAML
Installation
Install minikube on your machine.
Clone the repository provided on the IP. (git clone https://github.com/Mbuthiapeter/Yolo-Orchestration.git)
Install all dependencies needed.
Build the Docker images, ensure your containers are building independently.
Start the application.
Create the deployment, service, config, and PVC YAML files.
Deploy on GKE and access the external IP from the services.
Configuration
The following environment variables can be configured for the backend:

MONGODB_URI: The URI for connecting to the MongoDB database.
NODE_ENV: The environment mode (e.g., development, production).
Create a .env file in the backend directory and set the values for the above variables:

MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/yolo-app
NODE_ENV=development
Usage
Access the web application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Access the database in your browser at http://localhost:5000.

You can try to add an item for object detection.

MongoDB Atlas used as the backend database. You can use your connection string to test the same.
